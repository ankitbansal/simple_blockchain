# Basic Structure of Blockchain
-- In this example we familiarize ourselves with the basic structure of blockchain and terminologies used
-- We use nonce to demonstrate how can generation of hash be cpu consuming and demonstrating basic idea of Proof of Work
-- Blockchain is stored in a simple array 
-- We follow TDD in the whole exercise

#Persistence
-- If you don't want to look into persistence and is just interested in seeing a simple blockchain, checkout release_v1
-- In the second part, we persist our blockchain in BoltDB
